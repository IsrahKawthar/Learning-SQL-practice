# Learning SQL queries practice

## Project Description
This repository shows my process of following along with Alex The Analyst's SQL tutorials on YouTube. 
The goal was to learn SQL queries and skills,following his tutorials and I've added my personal notes to these so I can understand what the code does, see where I've made mistakes and learn from them.

**Disclaimer**: This is a collection of learning exercises. The project concepts, instructions, and original datasets were obtained from [Alex the Analyst's SQL youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgRwITQHszU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8FE_XZ87vPPSfHqb6OcM0cF&index=3)
This repository is solely for educational purposes to document my personal learning journey.
